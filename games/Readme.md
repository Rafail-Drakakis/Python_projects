Games

Town of Salem
The Town of Salem game allows players to participate, each with a specific role: Citizen, Doctor, or Gangster. The player information is loaded dynamically from a file, allowing for customizable usernames and roles. The game consists of day and night phases, where players make decisions and take actions.

Hangman
The Hangman game randomly chooses a word from a list and you need to guess the word by entering letters. You have six lives, and you lose a life for every incorrect guess. The game ends when you guess the word or run out of lives.

Labyrinth
The Labyrinth game generates a random maze and you have to find your way out of it. You start at the top left corner, and you have to reach the bottom right corner. You can only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. You need to use your arrow keys to move.

Rock Paper Scissors
The Rock Paper Scissors game allows you to play against the computer. You choose rock, paper or scissors, and the computer chooses a random play. The winner is determined based on the usual rock-paper-scissors rules.

Pong
The Pong game is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle and tries to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game ends when a player reaches 5 points.

Tic Tac Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a two-player game where each player takes turns placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) or when the grid is full and no one has won.
