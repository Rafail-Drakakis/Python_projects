This script, lotto_numbers.py, generates all possible combinations of 6 numbers from a range of 1 to 49 and writes them to a file named combinations.txt.

To measure the execution time of the function write_combinations_to_file, the time_function_execution function is used. It takes as input a function and its arguments and returns the time taken to execute the function. In this case, the write_combinations_to_file function is passed as an argument along with the filename combinations.txt. The execution time is printed to the console and returned.

Before you run the script, run pip install itertools time.
To run the script, simply execute it using a Python interpreter with the command main.py. The script will automatically create a file named combinations.txt and write all the possible combinations of 6 numbers to it. The execution time of the function will also be printed to the console.

It should be noted that generating all possible combinations of 6 numbers from a range of 1 to 49 is computationally intensive and may take some time to complete, depending on the hardware being used.
